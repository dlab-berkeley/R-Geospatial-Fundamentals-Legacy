### Import Libraries

```{r}
library(sf)
```

## 3.1 California County shapefile
Let's go ahead and bring back in our California County shapefile. As before, we can read the file in using `st_read` and plot it straight away.

```{r}
counties = st_read('notebook_data/california_counties/CaliforniaCounties.shp')
plot(counties$geometry, col='lightgrey', border='white')
```

Even if we have an awesome map like this, sometimes we want to have more geographical context, or we just want additional information. We're going to try **overlaying** our counties `sf` data.frame with data from a shapefile with USA states.

## 3.2 USA State shapefile

We're going to bring in our states data, and let's do the usual operations to start exploring our data.

```{r}
# Read in states shapefile
states = st_read('notebook_data/us_states/us_states.shp')
```

```{r}
# Look at the first few rows
head(states)
```

```{r}
# Count how many rows and columns we have
dim(states)
```

```{r}
# Plot our states data
plot(states['STATE'])
```

You might have noticed that our plot extends beyond the 50 states. Let's double check what states we have included in our data.

```{r}
states$STATE
```

Beyond the 50 states we seem to have American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands included in this spatial dataframe. To make our map cleaner, let's limit the states to the contiguous states (so we'll also exclude Alaska and Hawaii).

```{r}
# Define list of non-contiguous states
non_contiguous_us = c('American Samoa','Puerto Rico','Guam',
                      'Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands',
                      'United States Virgin Islands', 'Alaska','Hawaii')

# Limit data according to above list
states_limited = states[!states$STATE %in% non_contiguous_us, ]
```

```{r}
# Plot it
plot(states_limited['STATE'])
```

To prepare for our mapping overlay, let's make our states a nice, bold color

```{r, label='lower48'}
plot(states_limited$geometry, col='blue', border='red', lwd=5)
```

## 3.3 Plot the two together

Now that we have both geodataframes in our environment, we can plot both in the same figure.

> Once we've created a plot (using base R's `plot` function), we can add more layers to it by calling subsequent `plot` commands and adding the argument `add=T`.

```{r, label='overlay1'}
plot(counties$geometry, col='lightgrey', border='white')
plot(states_limited$geometry, col='blue', border='red',lwd=5, add=T)
```

Oh no, what happened here? Where's our CA data? What's going on?

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question** Without looking ahead, what do you think happened?

<br>
<br>
If you look at the coordinate values associated with the polygons in our two datasets, you'll see that the county data has much larger-magnitude numbers than our states data. It's represented in some different type of unit other than decimal degrees!

```{r, label='bboxes'}
print(st_bbox(counties))
print(st_bbox(states_limited))
```


This data misalignment is a key issue that you'll have to resolve time and time again when working with geospatial data!

It all revolves around **coordinate reference systems** and **map projections**.

----------------------------

## 3.4 Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question** Do you have experience with Coordinate Reference Systems?


<br><br>As a refresher, a CRS describes how the coordinates in a geospatial dataset relate to locations on the surface of the earth. 

A `geographic CRS` consists of: 

- a 3D model of the shape of the earth (a **datum**), approximated as a sphere or spheroid (aka ellipsoid)
- the **units** of the coordinate system (e.g, decimal degrees, meters, feet) and 
- the **origin** (i.e. the 0,0 location), specified as the meeting of the **equator** and the **prime meridian** 

A map projection is a mathematical model used to transform coordinate data from a curved to a flat surface.

A `projected CRS` consists of

- a geographic CRS
- a specific **map projection** and related parameters used to transform the geographic coordinates to `2D` space.

### A Geographic vs Projected CRS
<img src ="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/natureofgeoinfo/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.natureofgeoinfo/files/image/projection.gif" height="200" width="500"></src>

#### There are many, many CRSs

Theoretically the number of CRSs is unlimited!

Why? Primariy, because there are many different definitions of the shape of the earth, multiplied by many different ways to cast its surface into 2 dimensions. Our understanding of the earth's shape and our ability to measure it has changed greatly over time.

#### Why are CRSs Important?

- Most R spatial libraries, including `sf`, require geospatial data to have `the same CRS` for analysis.

- Most analysis methods expect geospatial data to be in a `projected CRS`.

- All `projected CRSs` introduce distortion in shape, area, and/or distance. So understanding what CRS best maintains the characteristics you need for your area of interest and your analysis is important.

- Some R packages, but not all, assume a specific CRS (WGS84) when a CRS is not explicitly defined. That can cause trouble if it is an incorrect assumption.

- In short, you need to know the CRS of your data to use it appropriately!

#### What you need to know when working with CRSs

- What CRSs used in your study area and their main characteristics
- How to identify, or `get`, the CRS of a geodataframe
- How to `set` the CRS of geodataframe (i.e. define the projection)
- Hot to `transform` the CRS of a geodataframe (i.e. reproject the data)

### Codes for CRSs commonly used with CA data

CRSs are typically referenced by an [EPSG code](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/European_Petroleum_Survey_Group).

The EPSG Registry maintains information about CRSs and specifies the short codes by which they are more easily referenced.

It's important to know the commonly used CRSs and their EPSG codes for your geographic area of interest.  

For example, below is a list of commonly used CRSs for California geospatial data along with their EPSG codes.


##### Geographic CRSs

- `4326: WGS84` (units decimal degrees) - the most commonly used geographic CRS

- `4269: NAD83` (units decimal degrees) - a geographic CRS customized to best fit the USA. This is used by most geographic data produced by US federal agencies including the Census.

  - `NAD83 (epsg:4269)` and `WGS84(epsg:4326)` geographic data can be considered equivalent although locations can differ by up to 1 meter in the continental USA and elsewhere up to 3m. That is not a big issue with census tract data as these data are only accurate within +/-7meters.


##### Projected CRSs

-`5070: USA CONUS NAD83` (units meters) projected CRS for mapping the entire contiguous USA (CONUS)

-`3857: Web Mercator` (units meters) conformal (shape preserving) CRS used as the default in web mapping

-`3310: CA Albers Equal Area, NAD83` (units meters)  projected CRS for CA statewide mapping and spatial analysis

-`26910: UTM Zone 10N, NAD83` (units meters) projected CRS for northern CA mapping & analysis

-`26911: UTM Zone 11N, NAD83` (units meters) projected CRS for Southern CA mapping & analysis

-`102641 to 102646: CA State Plane zones 1-6, NAD83` (units feet) projected CRS used for local analysis.

You can find the full CRS details on the website https://www.spatialreference.org

## 3.5 Getting the CRS of an `sf` data.frame

`sf` data.frames have CRS metadata. It can be accessed using the `st_crs` function.

```{r}
st_crs(counties)
```

```{r}
st_crs(states_limited)
```

As we can clearly see from those two printouts (even if we don't understand all the content!),
the CRSs of our two datasets are different! **This explains why we couldn't overlay them correctly!**


The above CRS definition specifies a bunch of information, including:

- the name of the CRS (`WGS84`), 
- the units (`degree`)
- the shape (`datum`),
- and the origin (`Prime Meridian`, and the equator)
- and the area for which it is best suited (`World`)

> Terminology Notes:
>
>    - `geocentric` latitude and longitude assume a spherical (round) model of the shape of the earth
>    - `geodetic` latitude and longitude assume a spheriodal (ellipsoidal) model, which is closer to the true shape.
>    - `geodesy` is the study of the shape of the earth.

## 3.6 Setting the CRS

You can also set the CRS of a spatial dataframe using the same `st_crs` function, but feeding a value into it.  You would only set the CRS if is not defined or if you think it is incorrectly defined.

> In desktop GIS terminology setting the CRS is called **defining the CRS**

As an example, we could try to set the CRS of our states data to Web Mercator (EPSG code 3857).

Note that `sf` lets us specify CRSs using just the EPSG codes as integers (not strings)!

```{r}
# What is the crs? Always check before setting!
print(st_crs(states_limited))

# Set the CRS - should only be done if not set!
st_crs(states_limited) = 26910
```

See that warning message? That's telling us that changing the CRS of a dataset by just replacing the current value using `st_crs` does not transform (i.e., reproject) the data. It just changes the metadata.

**THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT!** If we want to reproject a dataset (to reconcile its CRS with that of another dataset, for example), then this is **NOT THE WAY TO DO IT!** 

We'll see how to correctly reproject a dataset in just a second. In the meantime, **we'd better undo what we just did!**

```{r}
# Set the CRS back to what it was
st_crs(states_limited) = st_crs(states)
```

*What did we just do above?*

```{r}
# Check CRS again - is it set correctly?
st_crs(states_limited)
```

## PHEW! Okay! ... Never do that again! :)

## 3.7 Transforming or Reprojecting the CRS

You can transform the CRS of a geodataframe with the `st_transform` function. This outputs a new object with transformed coordinate data.


> In desktop GIS terminology transforming the CRS is called **projecting the data** (or **reprojecting the data**)

Let's transform the states data to Web Mercator (3857), giving the output dataframe a name that will make tje CRS obvious to us. This can be very helpful when working with multiple copies of a spatial dataframe.
```{r}
# Convert the states data to Web Mercator
states_limited_3857 = st_transform(states_limited, crs=3857)
```

Now take a look at the CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(states_limited_3857)
```

You can see the result immediately by plotting the data.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

# plot geographic sf data.frame
plot(states_limited$geometry, asp=1)

# plot utm sf data.frame
plot(states_limited_3857$geometry, asp=1)
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

1. What two key differences do you see between the two plots above?
2. Does either of these look better?
3. Look at the list of common CRSs above - is there another one we could try that would be a good fit for the states_limited data?

## 3.8 Plotting states and counties together

Now that we know what a CRS is and how we can set them, let's convert our counties `sf` data.frame to match up with the states' CRS.

```{r}
# Convert counties data to web mercator
counties_3857 = st_transform(counties, crs = 3857)

# or
#counties_3857 = st_transform(counties, 3857)
```

We can also do the transformation the following way to make sure the CRS values match:

```{r}
# Make sure the CRSs match!
counties_3857 = st_transform(counties, st_crs(states_limited_3857))
```

This last method is preferred when trying to do analysis with multiple data layers. Why? Because although data may be in the same CRS they could have very slightly different CRS metadata that could cause an error later on.

Take a look...
```{r}
plot(counties_3857$geometry)
```

Overlay...
```{r}
# Plot it together!
plot(states_limited_3857$geometry, col = 'lightgrey')
plot(counties_3857$geometry, col='darkgreen', add=T)
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question** The original counties data had the CRS CAL Albers (3310). Would it make sense to transform the states_limited to that CRS for mapping these two datasets?

### Practice

Let's see if the best CRS to plot both datasets is 5070. Start by transforming the data to that CRS.

```{r, eval=F}
states_limited_5070 = st_transform(...)
counties_5070 = st_transform(counties, st_crs())
```

Now make an overlay map!
```{r, eval=F}
plot(states_limited_5070$geometry, col = 'lightgrey')
plot(counties_5070$geometry, col = 'darkgreen', add=T)
```

What would you use for your map? Web Mercator (3857) or USA Conus (5070)?


## 3.9 Recap

In this lesson we learned about...

## Exercise: CRS Management

Now it's time to take a crack and managing the CRS of a new dataset. In the code cell below, write code to:

1. Bring in the CA places data (`notebook_data/census/Places/cb_2018_06_place_500k.zip`)
2. Check if the CRS of the data 
3. Transform the CRS to 3310
3. Plot the California counties and CA places together.

To see the solution, look at the hidden text below.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE






```

## Solution hidden here!

<!--

# SOLUTION

# 1. Bring in the CA places data
ca_places = st_read('notebook_data/census/Places/cb_2018_06_place_500k.shp')
head(ca_places)

# 2. Check the CRS
st_crs(ca_places)

# 3. Transform the CRS to 3310
ca_places_3310 = st_transform(ca_places, crs = 3310)

# 3. Plot the California counties and places together
plot(counties$geometry, col='lightgrey')
plot(ca_places_3310$geometry, col='purple',add = T)
