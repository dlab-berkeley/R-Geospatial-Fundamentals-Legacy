# Participant instructions

### Prior to the workshop start date please do the following.

1. Download and unzip (or clone, using the `git clone` command) this repository. To download, just click on the green **CODE** button near the top of the repo's home page - https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf. 
    > Note, the files are typically updated prior to a workshop so it's good to download these just before the workshop.


2. If you do not have R and RStudio installed on your computer, download and install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), with R version >= 3.5.

3. Then, open RStudio and install the following R packages, using the syntax **install.package('<pkg_name>')** 
  * `sf`
  * `tmap`
  * `units`
  * `tidyverse`
  * `raster`
  * `ggplot2`
  * `mapview`

If you are __prompted by the question__, "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", type "**no**" in your console and press Enter. (***Note**: This is most common for Mac users.*)

<!-- 
TO DO add confirmation code that their packages are installed correctly
4. After installation is complete, open the ['01-core_concepts_and_plotting.html'](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf/01-core_concepts_and_plotting.html#1) file in the 'docs' folder, to launch Pthe slides for Part I.
